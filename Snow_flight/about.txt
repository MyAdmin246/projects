"Snow Flights" is an exciting mobile game featuring a snowboarder who navigates two vertical paths by tapping to jump higher or fall lower. As the snowboarder rides, snowballs randomly fly across the screen, and players must evade them to survive. Each snowball avoided earns you 1 point, but crashing into a snowball ends the game and displays your score. Before starting, players can choose from a variety of snowboard styles and colors, allowing for a personalized gaming experience. Test your reflexes and see how long you can last in this winter wonderland!
